# Bird Strikes Data Visualization (2000-2011)

## Overview
This project analyzes bird strikes data from the FAA between 2000-2011. The aim is to identify trends, impacted airlines, economic costs, and other insights through various data visualizations.

## Introduction
Bird strikes pose a significant threat to aircraft safety, with potential damage ranging from structural harm to engine failure. This study analyzes bird strikes data to identify key trends and provide actionable insights for improving aviation safety.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes bird strikes reported to the FAA between 2000-2011. It contains various attributes such as the date and location of the strike, the type of aircraft, and the reported damage and cost.

## Data Cleaning
Steps taken to clean the data:
- Dropped unnecessary columns.
- Renamed columns for easier access.
- Removed duplicates and rows with missing values.
- Converted relevant columns to appropriate data types.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Number of Bird Strikes**: Total bird strikes reported annually from 2000 to 2011.
- **Top Affected Airlines**: List of top 10 US airlines with the highest number of bird strikes.
- **Economic Impact**: Annual costs incurred due to bird strikes.
- **Altitude and Phase of Flight**: Common altitudes and phases of flight most prone to bird strikes.

## Visualizations

5. **Geographical Distribution**:
   

##conclusion
- Total bird strikes reported: 1,995
- Year with the most strikes: 2010 (250 incidents)
- Most affected airline: American Airlines (300 strikes)
- Total economic cost: $20,000,00
  
##Recommendations
- Implement advanced bird detection systems at airports.
- Increase pilot training for bird strike awareness and response.
- Enhance wildlife management practices around airports.

##Future Work
- Extend the analysis to include more recent data.
- Develop predictive models to anticipate and mitigate bird strike risks.
- Investigate the impact of different bird species on strike severity.
